\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In the second period of the ESA1 semester (2016/2017) at Windesheim the
students were tasked with creating a bomberman game using embedded systems and
related technology. For this project we grouped together and eventually
decided to call our group and the game 'Vengabombers'. Our group consists of
five people: Erik Nijenhuis, Ruben Oost, Joram Schrijver, Martijn Thijmes and
Evan van Urk.

The project itself consisted of implementing a multiplayer game of bomberman
using two Arduino Uno boards which would communicate with eachother via
infrared LEDs and receivers. Furthermore both devices would have a Watterott
MI0283QT LCD screen to display the game and a Wii Nunchuck controller to
control the game. All of the requirements were met with the exception of a
working IR connection.

This document describes the technical workings and the choices we have made
regarding our implementation. We cover the code and highlight points of
interest as well as the hardware and how it's wired up.
